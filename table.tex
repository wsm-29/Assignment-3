{\parbox{4.8in}{\footnotesize Notes: This table presents OLS regression models estimating the causal effect of being ranked as a 'Top Basketball Program' in 2017 on alumni donations in 2018. Model 1 controls for the school's academic quality, athletic program quality, and proximity to large metropolitan areas. Model 2 expands on this by incorporating block fixed effects, which are based on each school's propensity score calculated using characteristics such as academic quality, athletic program quality, and proximity to large metropolitan areas.\\Standard errors are in parentheses. \sym{*} \(p<0.05\), \sym{**} \(p<0.01\), \sym{***} \(p<0.001\)
